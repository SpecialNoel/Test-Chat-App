'''
Current Issues:
1. Server cannot be found by devices other than its same device. Need to update SERVER_HOST to Server device's private IP address.
2. Potential improvement: Do some printing in the Server terminal:
    a. print out the username with the address for each newly joined Client.
    b. print out a line stating which Client has joined or leaved the chatroom.
    c. print out the current chatroom (with pairs of username and address) whenever a Client joins or leaves.
3. Add a feature where the Server handles multiple chatrooms at the same time.
   Client can create a new room or join an existing room via a unique valid room code.

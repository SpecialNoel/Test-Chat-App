# Client.py

# Run the program with command: python3 Client.py
# Make sure to run the server program (Server.py) first before running the client program

'''
Current Issues:
1. Client needs to stop the daemon thread it created gracefully. See this website for more detail: https://superfastpython.com/stop-daemon-thread/.
2. Need to limit the max and min length of username. After that, adjust the name format with printf based on the max length.
